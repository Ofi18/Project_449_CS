How can you use the chat application? 
You can use the chat application by installing the application in any phone that works in android system or environment. 
Then, you register to the application if it is your first time using the application. Furthermore, you can register 
to the application with any e mail account (Google, Hotmail, Yahoo…) and create user name and create your password. 
After that, you will log in with your e mail and password that’s you set up before in the registration step. 
Then, you enter the chat room and starting to chat whatever users are using the application. 
In other words, you will be able to chat whatever who enter the chat room. 
The features, you could see and reed your previous messages or conversations as long as you log in with same e mail and password 
that you log in before. In addition, you can use keyboard features that I provided to be available to use 
such as dictionary, google search, changings languages, using emoji and changing keyboard backgrounds. 
Finally, I hope you like the application.
